PHP bindings for the StormOnDemand API

## Usage ##

Usage is relatively straight forward.

Take a look at examples/serverlisting.php to see the basics of using the library.

Additionally, StormAPI.class.php utilizes PHPDoc for friendly generation of documentation for the library.
This of course is also handy for certain IDEs, such as Eclipse when using PDT.
